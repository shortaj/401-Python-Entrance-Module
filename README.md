# 401-Python-Entrance-Module

This is a python module that will generate a K-12 school to the specifications of the 401 python entrance exam for code fellows.

Two classes were created in order to use them as data storage. I have recently become aware that there are better methods to use but I don't have the time to figure it out then implement it successfully.

I generated three static lists to use as resources for a random school generator.
In order to maintain a random output I simply made 3 elements random, the GPAs, and shuffling the both sets of names.

Then at the end I made an iterator that fed into the classes and appends values.
